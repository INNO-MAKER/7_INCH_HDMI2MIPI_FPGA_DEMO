WARNING:NgdBuild - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance
   'top_nto1_pll_diff_rx_i/inst_clkin/rx_pll_adv_inst' of type PLL_ADV has been
   changed from 'VIRTEX5' to 'SPARTAN6' to correct post-ngdbuild and timing
   simulation for this primitive.  In order for functional simulation to be
   correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in this same manner in the
   source netlist or constraint file.

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (41.666000)
   was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "disp_clk_crm_i/disp_clk_wizard_i/dcm_clkgen_inst".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (40 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the
   non-default attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for DCM output clocks.
WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (33.75) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL
   "u_mig_39_2/memc3_infrastructure_inst/u_pll_adv".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (40 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the
   PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for PLL output clocks.
